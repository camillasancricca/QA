      "ID 1509: The steps in longitudinal bone growth at the epiphyseal plate involve the plate's chondrocytes undergoing constant division by mitosis. These daughter cells stack facing the epiphysis while older cells are pushed towards the diaphysis. As the older chondrocytes degenerate, osteoblasts ossify the remains to form new bone. In puberty, increasing levels of estrogen in both females and males lead to increased apoptosis of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate. The depletion of chondrocytes due to apoptosis leads to less ossification, and growth slows down and later stops when the entire cartilage has been replaced by bone, leaving only a thin epiphyseal scar, which later disappears.\n",

In American football, the field is reset after each tackle, making it slower-paced, whereas in rugby league, play stops only briefly for the tackled player to get back on their feet and return the ball. In rugby league, only the player with the ball can be interfered with; interfering with other attacking players results in a penalty. While backward passing is common in both, American football allows forward passes in certain situations, which is always illegal in rugby league. To score a try or touchdown in rugby league, the player must push the ball directly onto the ground in the try zone, while in American football, the player only needs to cross the line. American football also requires extensive protective equipment like helmets, gloves, and body padding, whereas rugby league has much more minimal protective clothing, usually light padding and soft headgear (hard helmets are illegal).

      "ID 1088: Rain occurs in a warm front when the air mass rises, expands, and cools, causing water vapor to condense and form extensive cloud cover. The first clouds indicating an approaching warm front are high cirrus, changing to cirrostratus. When these high clouds progressively invade the sky and barometric pressure falls, precipitation is likely about 6 to 8 hours away. A thickening and lowering of these high clouds into middle-étage altostratus or altocumulus signifies the warm front or low has moved closer, and precipitation may begin within less than six hours. Once clouds thicken to 2,500 meters (8,200 ft) from the surface, precipitation can fall from heavy nimbostratus. If unstable altocumulus castellanus is present, cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus producing showers or thunderstorms may follow. Low stratus and stratocumulus commonly form beneath the main precipitating clouds.\n",

Immediately after the earthquake, the active reactors automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions. However, the tsunami disabled the emergency generators that were supposed to provide power to control and operate the pumps necessary to cool the reactors. This insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive material in Units 1, 2, and 3 from March 12 to March 15. The loss of cooling also raised concerns over the recently loaded spent fuel pool of Reactor 4, which increased in temperature on March 15 due to decay heat from the freshly added spent fuel rods, but it did not boil down to exposure.\n",

The other seven names on these prototypes were Olive Borden, Ronald Colman, Louise Fazenda, Preston Foster, Burt Lancaster, Edward Sedgwick, and Ernest Torrence. The first *permanent* star completed was director Stanley Kramer's on March 28, 1960. The legend that Joanne Woodward was the first may have arisen because she was the first to pose with her star for photographers.\n",

      "ID 1143: Trade played a significant role in the Olmec civilization, as indicated by the widespread distribution of Olmec artifacts and iconography throughout Mesoamerica, which suggests the presence of extensive long-distance trade networks. This trade facilitated the movement of exotic, prestigious, and high-value materials, such as greenstone and marine shell, over considerable distances. A key reason for this trade was the scarcity of obsidian in the Olmec heartland, despite its use in many tools for its very sharp and durable worked edges; most obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala, demonstrating the extensive nature of this exchange. Although the Olmec were not the first to organize long-distance exchanges in Mesoamerica, their period saw a substantial expansion in interregional trade routes, an increased variety of material goods being exchanged, and a greater diversity in the sources from which these base materials were acquired.\n",

      "ID 1232: Olive oil extraction is the process of extracting the oil present in olive drupes. This oil is produced in the mesocarp cells and stored in lipo vacuoles, with every cell containing a tiny olive oil droplet. The process involves separating the oil from other fruit contents, which include vegetative extract liquid and solid material, by physical means alone because oil and water do not mix.

      "ID 1251: The significant outcomes of the War of 1812 on the United States included two centuries of peace between the United States and Britain. The causes of the war, such as the war between Britain and France, and the power of Indians to block American expansion into the Northwest, disappeared. American fears of Native Americans ended, as did British plans to create a buffer Native American state. The American quest for honor after humiliations by the British was satisfied. The final collapse of the opposition Federalist Party opened an \"Era of good feelings\" with lessened partisanship and an exuberant spirit. The U.S. failed to gain any territory from British North America but did gain land from Spain.\n",
      "ID 1252: In federal court, every person accused of a crime punishable by incarceration for more than six months has a constitutionally protected right to a trial by jury, originating from Article Three of the United States Constitution and expanded by the Sixth Amendment. Both these provisions were made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Most states' constitutions also grant the right to trial by jury in lesser criminal matters, though this right has been abrogated for offenses punishable by fine only in most states. Under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, if a defendant is entitled to a jury trial, they may waive this right, but both the government (prosecution) and court must consent. Several states require jury trials for all crimes, regardless of severity.\n",

      "ID 1258: The idea for a cake soaked in liquid is likely of Medieval European origin, as similar cakes like British Trifle, rum cake, and tiramisu use this method. Recipes for soaked-cake desserts appeared in Mexico as early as the 19th century, probably due to significant cross-cultural transfer between Europe and the Americas. Its widespread popularity throughout Latin America may be explained by recipes appearing on Nestlé condensed milk can labels in the 1940s, as the company had established subsidiaries in Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela in the 1930s. In recent years, its popularity has increased in Turkey under the name of Trileçe.\n",
      "ID 1259: The original sandstone for the White House construction came from Aquia Creek in Stafford County, Virginia. Although there are conflicting claims, with some reports suggesting sandstone from the Croatian island of Brač was used, researchers believe limestone from Brač was used in the 1902 renovations and not the original construction, reinforcing that the original sandstone was local to Virginia, as importing it would have been too costly.\n",

      "ID 1272: In thermodynamics, heat is energy transferred from one system to another as a result of thermal interactions. The amount of heat transferred is the total transferred energy excluding macroscopic work and transfer of part of the object itself. When two systems with different temperatures are in contact, heat flows spontaneously from the hotter to the colder system. Heat transfer can occur through direct contact, through a barrier impermeable to matter (conduction), by radiation between separated bodies, by an intermediate fluid (convective circulation), or a combination of these. Unlike work, heat involves the stochastic (random) motion of particles equally distributed among all degrees of freedom.\n",

      "ID 1276: The context does not explicitly state when babies are no longer obligate nose breathers, but it describes human infants as commonly being obligate nasal breathers, preferring to breathe through their nose. It notes that most infants can breathe through their mouth if their nose is blocked, but some infants with conditions like choanal atresia have died from nasal obstruction. In such cases, there can be cyclical periods of cyanosis, where the infant tries to breathe nasally, is unable, hypercapnia occurs, and many instinctively cry, leading to oral ventilation and subsiding cyanosis. There is variation in how long it takes for a baby to start oral breathing, and some may continue attempts at nasal breathing. It is also suggested that infants might not be able to sustain oral breathing for long periods due to weak muscles needed to seal the nasal airway and open the oral airway.\n",

I'm from Missouri, and you have got to show me.\" This aligns with the saying \"I'm from Missouri,\" meaning \"I'm skeptical of the matter and not easily convinced.\" Another origin suggests it refers to Missouri miners who were sent to Leadville, Colorado, to replace striking workers. Being unfamiliar with the mining methods, they required frequent instruction.\n",

In these contexts, \"God bless you\" or \"bless you\" acted as a protective shield against evil. Additionally, some people in the past may have thought the heart stops beating during a sneeze, and the phrase encouraged its continued beating.\n",

It was initially a sarcastic remark made by creationists. The notion that people were descended from apes was considered blasphemous by Darwin's contemporaries, which led to the sarcastic phrase being used to express complete surprise, amazement, or disbelief, or to acknowledge the impossibility of a situation.\n",
      "ID 1314: The full form of UNICEF is the United Nations Children's Fund. It was originally established as the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund by the United Nations General Assembly on December 11, 1946, to provide emergency food and healthcare to children in countries devastated by World War II.

      "ID 1315: A sentence of \"a year and a day\" for felonies serves several purposes:\n",
      "1. It is a minimum incarceration sentence for felonies in many jurisdictions, distinguishing felonies from misdemeanors, as misdemeanors traditionally do not entail a sentence of a year or more.\n",

However, it was only since 1869 that a number of educated individuals, such as missionaries, musicians, artists, professionals, and businesspeople, began arriving from Italy for non-economic reasons, spurred by persecution from Austrian authorities in northern Italy after the revolts of the 1840s and 1850s.\n",
      "ID 1318: The causes of post-term births are unknown, but post-mature births are more likely when the mother has experienced a previous post-mature birth. Due dates can be easily miscalculated if the mother is unsure of her last menstrual period, which can lead to the baby being delivered before or after the expected date. Irregular menstrual cycles can also contribute to post-mature births, as it makes judging the time of fertilization difficult. Some pregnancies are technically not post-mature, but appear so because the mother is uncertain of her last period. However, in most countries using ultrasound scan technology for gestation measurement, this is less likely.\n",

Jax tries to make a deal with Marks: the body's location for Bobby. Moses's men then force Bobby to the ground and sever a number of his fingers on his clutch hand. Later, an exchange is arranged between SAMCRO and August to trade the pastor's body and incriminating cell phone footage for Bobby. Jax and the pastor's son hand over the body and phone to August, who brings a bound and gagged Bobby. Bobby attempts to warn Jax before August pulls out a hidden gun and points it at Jax.

As Damocles sat on the king's throne, surrounded by luxury, Dionysius arranged for a huge sword to hang above the throne, held only by a single horse's tail hair.

      "ID 1333: Republican and Whig political ideas significantly influenced American colonists by convincing them to be vigilant against any perceived threats to their liberties. These ideas resonated deeply because they revived traditional Protestant and Puritan concerns, such as the belief that moral decay threatened free government. The colonists were already accustomed to the importance of virtue, frugality, industry, and calling in their moral code. Furthermore, these ideas highlighted the dangers of an overbearing executive and corruption from idle officials, concepts that were central to the colonists' understanding of their exile in America. Many of the ideas adopted by the American Revolutionaries in their political system were part of the 18th-century commonwealthmen tradition.\n",

Its purpose extends to conveying her evolving understanding that God had orchestrated this loss to guide her family towards a more pious life. Through the poem, she expresses her guilt over being saddened by the loss of earthly possessions, recognizing this feeling as contrary to her beliefs and indicative of sin. Ultimately, her deep Puritan convictions enabled her to accept the material loss as a spiritually necessary event, intended to combat her family's sins of material idols.\n",

      "ID 1349: After emancipation, convict leasing began during the Reconstruction Period in the United States, providing a new labor system for the South. Farmers and businessmen needed to replace the labor force after their slaves were freed. Southern states facilitated this by passing Black Codes, which restricted the free movement of Black individuals and compelled them into employment with whites. When Black people were convicted of vagrancy or other petty offenses, they could be imprisoned, and states then leased this convict labor to plantations and other facilities in need of workers, particularly as freedmen sought to withdraw and work independently. This system served a dual role: it generated a new source of revenue for financially strained states, and it allowed lessees to profit from forced labor at rates below market value.\n",

      "ID 1379: BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are normally expressed in the cells of breast and other tissues, where they play a crucial role in DNA repair by helping to fix damaged DNA or destroying cells if the DNA cannot be adequately repaired. They are specifically involved in the error-free repair of chromosomal damage, particularly DNA double-strand breaks. There is a direct relationship between their role in DNA repair and cancer predisposition: if BRCA1 or BRCA2 itself is damaged by a mutation, the damaged DNA is not repaired correctly, which consequently increases the risk for breast cancer. The predominant allele of these genes functions as a normal tumor suppressor; however, high penetrance mutations lead to a loss of this tumor suppressive function, which is correlated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. These genes are also known as \"breast cancer susceptibility genes\" and produce \"breast cancer susceptibility proteins.\"\n",

      "ID 1394: The formation of an alluvial fan is similar to the formation of a delta in that both involve depositional processes where sediment is redistributed from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This process results in the smoothing of the delta's planform shape as channels move across its surface and deposit sediment, causing the delta to approximate a fan shape. Alluvial fan deltas, in particular, are noted for avulsing frequently, which leads them to more closely resemble an ideal fan shape due to more rapid changes in channel position and uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front.\n",

      "ID 1438: The indirect rule system in Nigeria had both advantages and disadvantages. From the perspective of the European powers, an advantage was that it was cheaper and easier to implement, requiring fewer administrators. However, there were several disadvantages. The new leaders, such as \"warrant chiefs\" in Southern Nigeria, were not always supported by the local population. European ruling classes often selected local leaders based on traits similar to their own, even when these traits were ill-suited to native leadership. This approach also fostered a conservative outlook among the indigenous population and marginalized the young intelligentsia. Furthermore, the introduction of written laws, which replaced more flexible oral laws, proved less adaptable to changing social dynamics. Old customs of retribution and justice were either removed or banned, and the elimination of more violent punishments in certain areas led to an increase in crime. Additionally, leaders empowered by European governments frequently lacked familiarity with their new responsibilities, such as recruitment and tax collection.\n",

      "ID 1442: The location of Chicago profoundly influenced its development, presenting both crucial advantages and initial limitations. A key geographical feature was the now-vanished Mud Lake in the Des Plaines River watershed; during heavy rains or Des Plaines River overflows, water would flow through Mud Lake to the South Branch of the Chicago River, creating a favored portage for early traders and establishing the future path for the I&M and Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canals. However, when the city was founded in the 1830s, the land was swampy, and early construction primarily occurred on low dunes around the Chicago River's mouth. The low-lying geography, while eventually crucial for its development as a boom town due to the Chicago Portage and canal, initially hindered substantial early settlement because the surrounding tall grass prairie, underlain by hard-packed glacial clay, created extensive forbidding wetlands. Therefore, Chicago's 19th-century development involved both leveraging and overcoming these geographical characteristics.\n",

It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a conduction electron, which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty, electrons cannot move in the solid; however, if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band, current can flow. Semiconductors are substances with smaller band gaps compared to insulators, which have large band gaps, and conductors, which have very small band gaps or none. The band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid.\n",

      "ID 1488: Humans and animals get mercury poisoning from fish primarily through ingestion. Mercury, typically as methyl mercury, is absorbed by algae at the bottom of the food chain. Fish and other organisms higher in the food chain then eat this algae. Fish efficiently absorb methyl mercury but excrete it very slowly because it is not soluble. This leads to the accumulation of mercury, mainly in the viscera and muscle tissue, a process called bioaccumulation. As fish age, they may absorb more mercury. This mercury then biomagnifies up the food chain, meaning anything that eats these fish consumes higher concentrations of mercury. Predatory fish like swordfish and sharks, or birds like osprey and eagles, accumulate significantly higher concentrations of mercury in their tissue than can be accounted for by direct exposure alone. Species at higher trophic levels can amass body concentrations of mercury up to ten times higher than the species they consume.\n",

The excited dye then relaxes by releasing a photon, which is the emitted light. This reaction releases energy mostly as light, with very little heat, because the reverse 2+2 photocycloaddition of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a forbidden transition and cannot proceed through a regular thermal mechanism.\n",

During puberty, increasing levels of estrogen in both females and males lead to increased apoptosis of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate.

It is used to reduce bleeding and cramping of the uterus, can prevent postpartum or post-abortion hemorrhage, and can reduce pain. It may also reduce the need for uterotonics, which are medications that cause the uterus to contract. Crucially, it is used to treat uterine atony, a condition where the uterus lacks muscle tone and is soft to the touch instead of firm.\n",

      "ID 1034: There are several differences between rugby and American football. American football games are much slower-paced than rugby league matches because the field is reset after each tackle in American football, whereas in rugby league, play only stops for the time it takes the tackled player to get back up and return the ball. In rugby league, only the player with possession of the ball may be interfered with, and defending players interfering with any other attacking player will incur a penalty. Passing in American football allows for forward throws in certain situations, but in rugby league, forward passing is always illegal, requiring players to kick or run the ball forward to advance it. To score in rugby league, a player must push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, while in American football, the player simply needs to cross the line. American football also requires extensive protective equipment like helmets, gloves, and body padding, whereas rugby league uses much more minimal protective clothing, typically light padding and soft head gear (hard helmets are illegal). A major difference is that rugby fields are 100 meters, while American football fields are 100 yards.\n",

      "ID 1064: Hip hop originated in the South Bronx, New York City, in the 1960s and 1970s. It emerged from neighborhood block parties thrown by the Ghetto Brothers, a Puerto Rican group. Members of the scene plugged in amplifiers for their instruments and PA speakers into lampposts on 163rd Street and Prospect Avenue, using their live music events to break down racial barriers between African-Americans, Puerto Ricans, Whites, and other ethnic groups. Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc played a key role in developing hip hop music. At 1520 Sedgwick Avenue, Herc mixed samples of existing records and deejayed percussion \"breaks,\" combining this music with his Jamaican-style \"toasting\" (chanting and boastful talking over a microphone) to energize the crowd and dancers. Kool Herc is credited as the \"father\" of hip hop for developing key DJ techniques that, along with rapping, founded the music style by creating rhythmic beats through looping \"breaks\" (small percussive portions of songs) on two turntables. This was later accompanied by \"rapping\" or \"MCing\" and beatboxing. An original form of dancing called breakdancing, which later included popping, locking, and other moves, also developed, performed to hip hop songs played on boom boxes, alongside particular fashion styles.\n",

      "ID 1066: The Neolithic agricultural revolution is considered a turning point in history because agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn fostered larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies led to different means of decision-making and governmental organization. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite who were not directly engaged in agriculture, industry, or commerce, but dominated their communities and monopolized decision-making. Additionally, Jared Diamond identifies that the availability of milk and/or cereal grains permitted mothers to raise both an older (e.g., 3 or 4-year-old) child and a younger child concurrently, which was not previously possible. This resulted in a population's ability to significantly and more rapidly increase its size, provided resources were available.\n",

      "ID 1076: The United States escalated its role in the Vietnam War due to a common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam, stemming from 20 years of political and economic action. The main intent was to restrict Communist domination in the Vietnamese government, which was feared would lead to neighboring countries adopting communism and thus alter the balance of power throughout Southeast Asia. The U.S. foreign policy establishment perceived this communist expansion as a disturbance to national security interests and strove to end it. The escalation involved President Harry S. Truman providing progressively increasing financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam, who were U.S. allies. From the spring of 1950, U.S. involvement grew from merely assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

      "ID 1083: The male hormone testosterone plays a significant role in puberty by stimulating the growth of spermatogenic tissue in the testicles, male fertility, and penis or clitoris enlargement, along with increased libido and frequency of erection or clitoral engorgement. It contributes to the growth of the jaw, brow, chin, and nose, as well as the remodeling of facial bone contours, in conjunction with human growth hormone. Testosterone also leads to the completion of bone maturation and the termination of growth. It causes increased muscle strength and mass, broader shoulders, an expanding rib cage, deepening of the voice, and the growth of the Adam's apple. Additionally, it causes the enlargement of sebaceous glands, which may lead to acne, and a decrease in subcutaneous fat in the face.

It uses lines that branch off in different directions, ending at a clade, which is a group of organisms with a last common ancestor. These lines can be traced back to their branching off points, which represent a hypothetical ancestor (not an actual entity). This hypothetical ancestor is inferred to exhibit the traits shared among the terminal taxa above it, potentially providing clues about the order of evolution of various features, adaptation, and other evolutionary narratives about ancestors. Cladograms are generated using morphological characters, and commonly now also use DNA and RNA sequencing data and computational phylogenetics, either alone or in combination with morphology. However, a cladogram is not an evolutionary tree because it does not show how ancestors are related to descendants, nor how much they have changed; instead, many evolutionary trees can be inferred from a single cladogram.\n",

Immediately after the earthquake, the active reactors automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions. However, the tsunami subsequently disabled the emergency generators that were essential for powering the pumps required to cool the reactors. This insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive material in Units 1, 2, and 3 between March 12 and March 15.

It arose from the post-industrial and ravaged South Bronx, serving as a form of expression for urban Black and Latino youth who had been marginalized. The movement focused on emceeing (or MCing) over \"breakbeats\" at outdoor house parties and neighborhood block party events. Jamaican-born DJ Clive \"Kool Herc\" Campbell is considered a founder, having pioneered the use of DJing percussion \"breaks\" in hip hop music. The movement started at Herc's home in a high-rise apartment at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue and spread across the entire borough. Herc created the blueprint for hip hop music and culture by building upon the Jamaican tradition of impromptu toasting, a spoken form of boastful poetry and speech over music. On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was the DJ at his sister's back-to-school party, where he extended the beat of a record by using two record players, isolating the percussion \"breaks\" with a mixer. Herc's experiments with making music using record players evolved into what is now known as breaking or \"scratching.\"\n",

In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king and would accept royal governors as his agents, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. This refusal to acknowledge parliamentary authority was a key factor\n",

      "ID 1187: The support among the British population was divided. The elite in Britain tended to support the Confederacy. In contrast, ordinary people in Britain tended to support the United States of America. Furthermore, Britons volunteered for the United States army. Officially, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the British Empire did not remain neutral throughout the American Civil War. The British legally recognized the status of the Confederate States of America, but never recognized it as a nation, nor did they sign a treaty with it or exchange ambassadors. Top British officials also debated intervention during the first 18 months of the war. Large-scale trade continued in both directions, with the Union shipping grain to Britain, and Britain sending manufactured items and munitions. British trade with the Confederacy fell over 90% from the prewar period, with a small amount of cotton going to Britain and some munitions slipped in by numerous small blockade runners. These blockade runners were operated and funded by British private interests, were legal under international law, and did not cause a dispute between the United States and the United Kingdom.\n",

      "ID 1188: Professional meteorologists worldwide use a definition for seasons established in 1780 by the Societas Meteorologica Palatina, which defines seasons as groupings of three whole months identified by the Gregorian calendar. Meteorological seasons are not reckoned by temperature. For temperate areas in the northern hemisphere, spring begins on 1 March, summer on 1 June, autumn on 1 September, and winter on 1 December. For the southern hemisphere temperate zone, spring begins on 1 September, summer on 1 December, autumn on 1 March, and winter on 1 June. These meteorological terms for seasons apply to the temperate zone in Australasia, which includes all of New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, the south-eastern corner of South Australia and the south-west of Western Australia, and the south east Queensland areas south of Brisbane. The seasons therefore end the day before the next season begins.\n",

Prior to this, Jesus' lifeless body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Before his body is entombed, Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies while hanging from the cross, after praying for forgiveness for those who tormented him and providing salvation to a criminal crucified beside him. Subsequently, a single droplet of rain falls, triggering an earthquake that destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the Holy of Holies in two, horrifying Caiaphas and other priests. During these events, Satan is shown screaming in agonizing defeat from the depths of Hell.\n",

      "ID 1211: In endotherms, heat in the body primarily comes from metabolic heat production. When external temperatures are cold, endotherms increase this metabolic activity to maintain a constant internal body temperature. This process is facilitated by their cells having a larger number of mitochondria than ectotherms, enabling them to generate more heat by metabolizing fats and sugars at an increased rate.\n",
      "ID 1212: The Society of Friends received their nickname \"Quakers\" in 1650.

Crimes that commonly lead to mandatory sex-offender classification include a second prostitution conviction, sending or receiving obscene text messages (sexting), and relationships between young adults and teenagers resulting in the corruption of a minor if the age difference exceeds 1,060 days. Child molestation occurs if any sexual contact is made by an adult to a minor. Other serious offenses include sexual assault, statutory rape, bestiality, child sexual abuse, female genital mutilation, incest, rape, and sexual imposition.

      "ID 1232: The process of making olive oil, known as olive oil extraction, involves separating the oil from other fruit contents, specifically vegetative extract liquid and solid material. Olive oil is produced and stored in the mesocarp cells of olive drupes.

Her deep Puritan beliefs led her to accept that the loss of material things was a spiritually necessary occurrence, meant to fight her family's sins of material idols.

      "ID 1438: In Southern Nigeria, a disadvantage of indirect rule was that if a suitable traditional leader could not be found, European authorities would choose local rulers, often called \"warrant chiefs,\" who were not always supported by the local population. These European ruling classes also frequently selected local leaders who shared similar traits with themselves, even if these traits were not suitable for native leadership. This system fostered a conservative outlook among the indigenous population and marginalized the young intelligentsia, as many chosen leaders were conservative elders. Written laws replaced oral laws, which were less flexible to changing social dynamics. Old customs of retribution and justice were removed or banned, and the removal of more violent punishments in some areas led to an increase in crime. Furthermore, leaders empowered by European governments were often not familiar with new tasks such as recruitment and tax. An advantage of indirect rule for European powers was that it was cheaper and easier, requiring fewer administrators.\n",

MLB objected to his desire to name the team the \"Twin Cities Twins,\" but the team was allowed to keep its original \"TC\" insignia for its caps. The team eventually felt established enough by 1987 to use an \"M\" on its cap without St. Paul fans thinking it stood for Minneapolis, moving the \"TC\" to a sleeve on the jerseys or using it as an alternate cap design.\n",

      "ID 1441: The 3/5 Compromise was an agreement reached during the Convention to determine representation in the House of Representatives. It addressed the issue of how to count enslaved individuals for apportionment purposes, given that slave states wanted them counted in their actual numbers for increased representation, while delegates opposed to slavery proposed counting only free inhabitants. The compromise stipulated that \"all other persons\" (slaves) would be counted as only three-fifths of their actual numbers. This arrangement reduced the representation of slave states relative to their original proposals but improved it compared to the Northern position. An additional incentive for slave states to accept the compromise was its linkage to taxation in the same ratio, which also reduced the burden of taxation on those states.\n",
      "ID 1442: Chicago's low-lying geography significantly influenced its development. It became crucial for its boomtown status as the site of the Chicago Portage and canal. During heavy rains or when the Des Plaines River overflowed due to ice dams, the river would flow through Mud Lake to the South Branch of the Chicago River, forming a favored portage for early traders and paving the way for future canals like the I&M and Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canals. However, this same geography, with tall grass prairie underlain by hard-packed glacial clay forming forbidding wetlands, initially hindered substantial early settlement. Thus, Chicago's 19th-century development involved both leveraging its unique geography and overcoming its inherent limitations.\n",

If the ECU detects a wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, which indicates an impending wheel lock, it actuates hydraulic valves to reduce pressure to the brake at that wheel, thereby reducing braking force and allowing the wheel to turn faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to that wheel is increased, reapplying braking force and slowing the wheel down. This continuous process can be felt by the driver as brake pedal pulsation, making it practically impossible to lock the wheels even during panic braking in extreme conditions.\n",
      "ID 1446: Broadly defined, homonyms are words that sound alike or are spelled alike but have different meanings. More restrictively, homonyms are words that are simultaneously homographs (sharing the same spelling) and homophones (sharing the same pronunciation), meaning they have identical pronunciation and spelling while maintaining different meanings. Examples include \"stalk\" (part of a plant) and \"stalk\" (follow/harass a person), or \"left\" (past tense of leave) and \"left\" (opposite of right). A distinction is also made between true homonyms, which have unrelated origins (e.g., \"skate\" as in glide on ice and \"skate\" as in the fish), and polysemous homonyms (polysemes), which share a common origin (e.g., \"mouth\" of a river and \"mouth\" of an animal).\n",
      "ID 1447: The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, represented an important turning point in the Civil War because, despite being a tactical draw, it marked the end of Robert E. Lee's invasion of the North. Lee's objectives to entice the slave-holding state of Maryland to join the Confederacy, recruit soldiers there, and marshal Northern fears to pressure a settlement to the war, all failed. It was also the bloodiest single day of conflict in American military history.\n",
      "ID 1448: The birth of the samurai is linked to Japan's widespread reforms following the Battle of Hakusukinoe in 663 AD, which led to a retreat from Korean affairs. One key reform was the Taika Reform in 646 AD, which allowed the Japanese aristocracy to adopt the Tang dynasty political structure, bureaucracy, culture, religion, and philosophy. As part of the Taihō Code of 702 AD, Imperial bureaucrats of the 6th rank and below were referred to as \"samurai\" and dealt with day-to-day affairs. Although these early \"samurai\" were civilian public servants, the modern word for military men is believed to have derived from this term. Military men would also be referred to as \"samurai\" much sooner than many centuries later.\n",
      "ID 1449: The money from the AJC Peachtree Road Race goes to cover various costs and to fund the Atlanta Track Club. The race pays between $25,000 and $30,000 to government agencies for their support costs, and t-shirts for runners and volunteers are estimated to cost over $200,000. Additionally, $25,000 is paid for its timing system and $100,000 for contract labor. The profits derived from race entry fees and sponsorships are specifically used to fund the Atlanta Track Club.\n",
      "ID 1450: To save her sixth son, Zeus, from being swallowed by Cronus, Rhea devised a plan with Uranus and Gaia. She gave birth to Zeus in Crete and then presented Cronus with a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed. Rhea then hid her infant son Zeus in a cave on Mount Ida, and her attendants, the warrior-like Kouretes and Dactyls, acted as his bodyguards to help conceal his whereabouts from his father.\n",
      "ID 1451: The song \"The House of the Rising Sun\" is of uncertain authorship. According to Alan Lomax, \"Rising Sun\" was a name used for bawdy houses and English pubs in two traditional English songs. Lomax also suggested that the melody might be related to a 17th-century folk song, \"Lord Barnard and Little Musgrave\" (also known as \"Matty Groves\"), though a survey by Bertrand Bronson found no clear relationship between the two. Lomax further proposed that the house's location was relocated from England to New Orleans by white southern performers.\n",
      "ID 1452: The song \"Human Again\" in the film \"Beauty and the Beast\" is primarily performed by Lumière (Jerry Orbach), Cogsworth (David Ogden Stiers), Mrs. Potts (Angela Lansbury), and The Wardrobe (Jo Anne Worley). Neither Belle nor the Beast sing in the song.\n",
      "ID 1453: French is spoken in Burkina Faso because it was introduced when France colonized the country in 1919 and became the official language. It is the principal language for administrative, political, and judicial institutions, public services, and the press, and the sole language for laws, administration, and courts. French also serves as the language of instruction in the nation's schools. Despite a low percentage of the population using French daily, there is high support for maintaining it as the language of instruction because it offers children a pathway to social mobility and ensures continued economic support for education.\n",

      "ID 1455: The first five episodes of \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" were filmed in Covington and Conyers, Georgia, and surrounding areas, including some location work in nearby Atlanta. Subsequently, production was moved from Georgia to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, California, as part of a plan to develop the show into a full-running series, primarily to simplify production and create a larger workshop for the numerous automobiles required.\n",
      "ID 1456: A derrickhand on an oil rig typically reports directly to the driller. The position's name comes from the derrickhand's usual location at the top of the derrick. From this elevated position, they guide the 90-foot (27 meters) stands of drill pipe into the fingers at the top of the derrick while tripping (removing the drill string) out of the hole. When tripping into the hole (or \"running in\"), they pull the pipe out of the fingers and guide it into the elevators suspended from the top drive. When not tripping pipe, derrickhands work closely with the mud engineer, monitoring pH and calcium levels, viscosity, and mud weight (density). They add sacks of chemicals (25-100 lb each) to the mud or oil to maintain desired properties and monitor the mud level in the mud pits for well control. They are also responsible for the shale shakers and mud pumps, ensuring their proper function and fixing them as needed. Additionally, a derrickhand is responsible for transferring supplementary fluids or chemicals, such as Barite, Bentonite, or oil-based fluids, from bulk silos or tanks to the mud system.\n",
      "ID 1457: In organic chemistry, a saturated compound is a chemical compound characterized by a chain of carbon atoms linked together exclusively by single bonds, with saturated hydrocarbons specifically known as alkanes. An unsaturated compound, in contrast, is a chemical compound that contains carbon-carbon double bonds or triple bonds, found in alkenes or alkynes, respectively. Both saturated and unsaturated compounds can form straight chain, branched chain, or ring arrangements and can possess functional groups. Only unsaturated compounds are those in which addition reactions can be obtained.\n",

      "ID 1468: In Season 2, T-Dog experiences several significant events. He slices his arm on a car door during a walker attack, leading Dale to believe he contracted a blood infection, for which Daryl provides antibiotics. T-Dog later journeys to Hershel's farm where he receives medical treatment for blood poisoning. He helps extract a walker from a well, and when it bursts, contaminating the water, he kills it with an axe. T-Dog assists in shooting walkers that emerge from Hershel's barn and helps burn their bodies. He also attends the debate over Randall's fate and witnesses Daryl mercy killing Dale. Later, T-Dog helps the group move into Hershel's home and notices Randall is missing from the barn. In the season finale, T-Dog escapes the farm with a few other survivors when it is overrun by walkers.\n",
      "ID 1469: The British royal family receives income from several sources. The UK Parliament provides financial support through the Sovereign Grant, which is a percentage of the Crown Estate's annual profits.

Additionally, other income sources include revenues from the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall, a parliamentary annuity, and income from private investments.\n",
      "ID 1470: The main idea of Anne Bradstreet's poem, \"Verses upon the Burning of our House,\" is her expression of traumatic loss after her home and possessions were destroyed by fire. She interprets this loss through her deep Puritan beliefs, understanding it as God's act to guide her family toward a more pious life. Despite feeling guilty for being saddened by earthly losses, she accepts the event as spiritually necessary and reminds herself that her true future and value lie in heaven. She also holds the belief that she is among the fortunate who have salvation, and that God will help His followers combat sin on Earth.\n",

      "ID 1475: The U.S. used chemical warfare, specifically aerial herbicide spraying, during the Vietnam War because President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam requested the United States to conduct such operations in his country. This led President John F. Kennedy to authorize Operation Ranch Hand, the U.S. Air Force's herbicide program, in November 1961.\n",
      "ID 1476: Britain's sea empire, known as the British Empire, comprised dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, its global expanse meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories, leading to the phrase \"the empire on which the sun never sets.\"\n",
      "ID 1477: As production increased to aid World War II efforts, the U.S. economy was significantly impacted. Greater wartime production created millions of new jobs, while the draft simultaneously reduced the number of young men available for civilian jobs. The immense demand for labor drew millions of retired people, housewives, and students into the workforce, motivated by patriotism and wages. The resulting shortage of grocery clerks prompted retailers to transition from service at the counter to self-service. The labor shortage, along with gasoline and tire rationing, caused most retailers to cease home delivery services, and they found that requiring customers to buy products in person increased sales.\n",
      "ID 1478: Pluto was the ruler of the underworld, with Hades being his earlier name that became more common as the name of the underworld itself. In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Pluto represents a more positive concept of the god presiding over the afterlife, and he was frequently conflated with Ploutos, a god of wealth. This conflation occurred because mineral wealth was found underground, and as a chthonic god, Pluto ruled the deep earth containing seeds for bountiful harvests. The name Ploutōn became widespread with the Eleusinian Mysteries, where Pluto was venerated as a stern ruler but also the loving husband of Persephone. Hades, by contrast, had few temples and religious practices associated with him and is portrayed as the dark and violent abductor of Persephone.\n",

      "ID 1480: The \"One Thousand and One Nights\" is a composite work with a complex history. Its earliest tales originated from India and Persia, and these were translated into Arabic as \"Alf Layla\" or \"The Thousand Nights,\" probably in the early 8th century, forming the collection's basis. In Iraq, during the 9th or 10th century, Arab stories, including tales about Caliph Harun al-Rashid, were added to this core. From the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were incorporated. A further layer of stories, often focusing on sex, magic, or low life, was added in Syria and Egypt from the 13th century onwards. Finally, in the early modern period, more stories were added to the Egyptian collections to expand the text to its full length of 1,001 nights.\n",
      "ID 1481: Blood plasma, a yellowish liquid component of blood, has several vital functions. It holds blood cells in suspension, serving as the extracellular matrix of blood cells. It constitutes the intravascular fluid part of extracellular fluid. Composed mostly of water (up to 95% by volume), it contains dissolved proteins (like serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen), glucose, clotting factors, electrolytes (Na, Ca, Mg, HCO, Cl), hormones, carbon dioxide (acting as the main medium for excretory product transportation), and oxygen. Plasma also functions as the human body's protein reserve, plays a crucial role in an intravascular osmotic effect that maintains electrolyte balance, and protects the body from infection and other blood disorders.\n",

      "ID 1484: In a semiconductor, a band gap (also called an energy gap) refers to an energy range within the solid where no electron states can exist. Specifically, in graphs of the electronic band structure, it is the energy difference (measured in electron volts) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. It represents the energy required to promote a valence electron, bound to an atom, to become a conduction electron that is free to move within the crystal lattice and act as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. The band gap is a major factor determining a solid's electrical conductivity; semiconductors have smaller band gaps compared to insulators.\n",
      "ID 1485: Peter Raymond Grant and Barbara Rosemary Grant are a British couple who are evolutionary biologists at Princeton University. They are known for their work with Darwin's finches on Daphne Major in the Galápagos Islands, where they have spent six months annually since 1973 capturing, tagging, and taking blood samples from finches. Through their work, the Grants have shown that natural selection can be observed within a single lifetime or even within a couple of years, demonstrating that these changes in populations can happen very quickly, contrary to Charles Darwin's initial thought that natural selection was a long, drawn-out process.\n",
      "ID 1486: When the First Fleet arrived in Australia, specifically at Botany Bay, life was challenging. It was soon realized that Botany Bay did not live up to Captain James Cook's glowing account; the bay was open and unprotected, the water too shallow for ships to anchor close to shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor. First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who appeared curious but suspicious. The area was studded with enormously strong trees, which convicts found difficult to cut down, causing their tools to break and requiring gunpowder to blast tree trunks out of the ground. Primitive huts built for officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. Marines habitually got drunk and failed to guard convicts properly, and their commander, Major Robert Ross, caused despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Critically, Phillip worried that the nascent colony was vulnerable to attacks from Aborigines or foreign powers.\n",
      "ID 1487: Driven by jealousy, Norman Bates murdered both his mother and her fiancé, Joe Considine, with strychnine. He then staged their deaths to appear as a murder-suicide, making it seem as though his mother had killed her fiancé and then herself.\n",
      "ID 1488: Humans get mercury poisoning from fish primarily through the consumption of fish, which is the most significant source of ingestion-related mercury exposure. Mercury and methyl mercury, initially present in very small concentrations in seawater, are absorbed by algae at the bottom of the food chain. This algae is then eaten by fish and other organisms higher up the food chain. Fish efficiently absorb methyl mercury but excrete it very slowly because it is not soluble. Consequently, methyl mercury accumulates in fish, primarily in their viscera and muscle tissue. This process, known as bioaccumulation, leads to a buildup of mercury in the adipose tissue of successive trophic levels (zooplankton, small nekton, larger fish, and so on). Older fish tend to have absorbed more mercury. Anything that consumes these fish within the food chain also ingests the higher levels of mercury accumulated by the fish, which explains why predatory fish like swordfish and sharks have higher concentrations.\n",

      "ID 1495: The light energy of a glowing light wand, or glow stick, comes from a chemical reaction. A glow stick contains two main chemicals and a suitable dye. When hydrogen peroxide from a glass vial is mixed with a mixture of the dye and diphenyl oxalate from the plastic tube, a chemical reaction occurs. This reaction produces phenol and a peroxyacid ester (1,2-dioxetanedione). The peroxyacid spontaneously decomposes into carbon dioxide, releasing energy that excites the dye. The excited dye then relaxes by releasing a photon, which is the emitted light. This process releases energy mostly as light, with very little heat.\n",

The daughter cells from this division then stack facing the epiphysis, while older cells are pushed towards the diaphysis. As these older chondrocytes degenerate, osteoblasts ossify the remaining structures to form new bone. Eventually, the depletion of chondrocytes due to apoptosis leads to less ossification, causing growth to slow down and eventually stop when the entire cartilage has been replaced by bone, leaving only a thin epiphyseal scar that later disappears.\n",

      "ID 1518: The poem \"The Tyger\" by William Blake lacks narrative movement and opens with the central question, \"What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" The contemplation continues with questions about the Tyger's creation: where it was created in the second stanza, how the creator formed it in the third, and what tools were used in the fourth. In the fifth stanza, Blake wonders about the creator's reaction to the Tyger and who created the creature. Finally, the sixth stanza restates the central question, escalating it by asking not merely what or who could create the Tyger, but who dares.\n",
      "ID 1519: In the context of returns to scale, increasing returns to scale (IRS) occur if output increases by more than the proportional change in inputs. Conversely, decreasing returns to scale (DRS) occur if output increases by less than the proportional change in inputs. A firm's production function can exhibit different types of returns to scale at various output levels; typically, increasing returns might be seen at relatively low output levels, decreasing returns at relatively high output levels, and constant returns at an output level between those ranges.\n",

They are considered to hold mysteriously unique artistic and creative abilities. They are very intelligent individuals with a wide appreciation for the arts, philosophy, history, and the natural sciences. They do not like boring people or routine procedures and struggle with authoritative figures. They are considered the most misunderstood of all signs due to their dual personality. They are sensitive but use their high intelligence to counter anything that upsets them.\n",
      "ID 1023: The context does not state that a Scottish immigrant made a fortune on steel, but rather that Carnegie built Pittsburgh's Carnegie Steel Company.

In American football, players are allowed to throw the ball forward in certain situations, while in rugby league, forward passing is always illegal. To score a try or touchdown in rugby league, the player must push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, whereas in American football, the player simply has to cross the line. American football requires a large amount of protective equipment, including helmets, gloves, and body padding, while rugby league uses much more minimal protective clothing, usually light padding (if any) and soft head gear (hard helmets are illegal).\n",

A 3,000-strong Free India Legion, comprising Indians captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, was formed to aid a possible future German invasion of India. By spring 1942, a German invasion of India became untenable, and Bose became keen to move to Southeast Asia. Adolf Hitler met with Bose in late May 1942 and suggested the move, offering to arrange a submarine. During this time, Bose also became a father; his wife, Emilie Schenkl, gave birth to a baby girl in November 1942.

      "ID 1053: The context explicitly states that the .380 ACP should not be confused with the .38 ACP, from which it was developed. It also lists \"380 Auto\" as another name for .380 ACP.

Specific locations included Tongariro National Park, and Cassiobury Park in Watford, Hertfordshire for the forest scenes on Naboo (though the context does not link Cassiobury Park to Lord of the Rings, it's mentioned for Star Wars). Re-reading, Cassiobury Park is for Phantom Menace. So, the locations for Lord of the Rings are New Zealand's conservation areas and national parks, and soundstages around Wellington and Queenstown.\n",
      "ID 1061: The context states that it is implied that Vyjayanthi's version of the story may be true and it is left to the audience as to who is Vyjayanthi's murderer. Therefore, the context does not explicitly state who killed the writer.\n",

      "ID 1066: The Neolithic agricultural revolution is considered a turning point in history because agricultural food production supported a denser population, which in turn supported larger sedentary communities, the accumulation of goods and tools, and specialization in diverse forms of new labor. Food surpluses made possible the development of a social elite not engaged in agriculture, industry, or commerce, but who dominated communities and monopolized decision-making. The availability of milk and/or cereal grains permitted mothers to raise both an older and a younger child concurrently, allowing a population to significantly increase its size more rapidly, resources permitting.\n",
      "ID 1067: In \"A Boy's Best Friend,\" Jimmy Anderson, a Moon-born ten-year-old, owns and loves a robotic dog named Robutt.

      "ID 1083: The male hormone testosterone plays a role in puberty by causing growth of the jaw, brow, chin, nose, and remodeling of facial bone contours, in conjunction with human growth hormone. It also leads to the completion of bone maturation and termination of growth, which occurs indirectly via estradiol metabolites. Testosterone also causes enlargement of sebaceous glands, which might lead to acne, and a decrease in subcutaneous fat in the face.

      "ID 1088: Rain occurs in a warm front when the air mass rises, expands, and cools, causing water vapor to condense and form extensive cloud cover. Precipitation is likely about 6 to 8 hours away when high clouds progressively invade the sky and barometric pressure falls. Precipitation may begin within less than six hours once these high clouds thicken and lower into middle-étage altostratus or altocumulus. If clouds have thickened to 2,500 meters (8,200 ft) from the earth's surface, precipitation can begin to fall from heavy nimbostratus.

Schleiden suggested in 1839 that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or the result of cells. In 1839, Theodor Schwann stated that along with plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures, which was a major advancement since little was known about animal structure compared to plants at that point. From these conclusions, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.\n",

      "ID 1120: The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster was initiated primarily by the tsunami following the Tōhoku earthquake on 11 March 2011. Immediately after the earthquake, the active reactors automatically shut down their sustained fission reactions. However, the tsunami disabled the emergency generators that would have provided power to control and operate the pumps necessary to cool the reactors. The insufficient cooling led to three nuclear meltdowns, hydrogen-air explosions, and the release of radioactive material in Units 1, 2 and 3 from 12 March to 15 March. Loss of cooling also raised concerns over the recently loaded spent fuel pool of Reactor 4, which increased in temperature on 15 March due to the decay heat from the freshly added spent fuel rods but did not boil down to exposure.\n",

It arose out of the ruins of a post-industrial and ravaged South Bronx, as a form of expression of urban Black and Latino youth. Jamaican-born DJ Clive \"Kool Herc\" Campbell pioneered the use of DJing percussion \"breaks\" in hip hop music. The movement began at Herc's home in a high-rise apartment at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. On August 11, 1973, DJ Kool Herc was the DJ at his sister's back-to-school party where he extended the beat of a record by using two record players, isolating the percussion \"breaks\" by using a mixer to switch between the two records, thereby creating the blueprint for hip hop music and culture.\n",

The author proclaims all actions of man to be inherently hevel, meaning \"vain\" or \"futile\" (\"mere breath\"), because both the wise and the foolish ultimately end in death. Despite this senselessness, the book endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life and suggests that one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and finding enjoyment in one's work, as these are gifts from God.

Exotic, prestigious, and high-value materials like greenstone and marine shell were moved in large quantities over great distances. Trade was also crucial due to the lack of obsidian in the Olmec heartland, which was used in many tools; most obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala, demonstrating extensive trade. The Olmec period saw a significant expansion in interregional trade routes, a greater variety in material goods exchanged, and a wider diversity in the sources from which base materials were obtained, although the Olmec were not the first in Mesoamerica to organize long-distance exchanges.\n",

The American quest for honor, following its humiliations by the British, was satisfied. The final collapse of the opposition Federalist Party inaugurated an \"Era of good feelings\" characterized by lessened partisanship and an exuberant spirit.

Its widespread popularity throughout Latin America may be attributed to recipes appearing on Nestlé condensed milk can labels in the 1940s, given that Nestlé had established subsidiaries in countries like Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela in the 1930s.

      "ID 1266: The context defines a common-source amplifier as one of three basic single-stage field-effect transistor (FET) amplifier topologies, typically used as a voltage or transconductance amplifier. In this specific circuit, the signal enters the gate, and exits the drain, with the source being the only remaining terminal. The context also mentions common-drain and common-gate stages in the context of a cascode amplifier, which is a common-source and common-gate combination. However, the context explicitly states that the easiest way to tell if a FET is common source, common drain, or common gate is not by examining where the signal enters and leaves, and that the remaining terminal is not known as \"common.\" It does not provide distinguishing characteristics for common-gate or common-drain amplifiers beyond their names and their role in a cascode amplifier.\n",

He is warned by Michael Eckman that Bianca is vapid and conceited, and that her overprotective father does not allow Bianca or her older, shrewish sister, Kat, to date. Bianca wishes to date the affluent senior Joey Donner, but her father, Walter, an obstetrician concerned about teenage pregnancy, will not permit his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this condition unlikely.\n",

The amount of heat transferred in any process can be defined as the total amount of transferred energy, explicitly excluding any macroscopic work that was done and any transfer of a part of the object itself. By contrast to work, heat involves the stochastic (random) motion of particles, such as atoms or molecules, that is equally distributed among all degrees of freedom. The context explicitly states that it is not true that when two systems with different temperatures are put in contact, heat flows spontaneously from the hotter to the colder system.\n",

The Kentucky Derby, for example, has a weight limit of 126 lb (57 kg) including the jockey's equipment. However, the context explicitly states that it is not true that the weight of a jockey usually ranges from 108 to 118 lb (49 to 54 kg), and therefore does not provide an average weight for a jockey.\n",

They manage the relationship with the client of their assigned accounts, rather than the daily running of the account itself. Account managers serve as the interface between the customer service and the sales team in a company.

      "ID 1281: Missouri's unofficial nickname, the \"Show Me State,\" which appears on its license plates, has its origins in two main accounts, although the context states it is not true that the phrase has several origins. One origin is popularly attributed to a speech by Congressman Willard Vandiver in 1899, where he declared, \"I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I'm from Missouri, and you have got to show me.\" This statement aligns with the saying \"I'm from Missouri,\" which means one is skeptical and not easily convinced, though researchers note the phrase was in use before the 1890s. Another origin states it is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville, Colorado, to replace striking workers and required frequent instruction due to their unfamiliarity with the mining methods.\n",

This suggests an early implementation of the idea of using interchangeable parts in manufacturing. Additionally, the Venetian Arsenal produced nearly one ship every day, functioning as the world's first factory and employing 16,000 people, which implies a form of mass production. The context explicitly states that the Venetians did not produce ships using prefabricated parts and assembly lines.

      "ID 1285: The \"Join, or Die\" political cartoon, drawn by Benjamin Franklin and first published on May 9, 1754, symbolized different ideas over time. During the French and Indian War, it was used to signify that the colonies needed to unite with the Kingdom of Great Britain to defeat the French and Indians. Later, it became a symbol of colonial freedom during the American Revolutionary War. The woodcut depicts a snake cut into eighths, with each segment representing one of the American colonies or regions, such as New England as a single segment.

Each girl in the club has distinct word preferences, and they will react when the player selects a word they like. Additional scenes can be unlocked for each girl if the player writes poems tailored to that girl's tastes and chooses the correct dialogue options.

      "ID 1297: To obtain a declaration of nullity from the Catholic Church, the parties must approach a Catholic diocesan tribunal. Most applications are granted because one or both parties are judged to have given invalid consent.

They must also intend the words they speak, meaning they intend to form a permanent and faithful partnership open to procreative sexual acts (Canon 1101). Serious failures in these areas can justify a successful application. Other reasons for alleging invalid consent include a serious error concerning the person to whom marriage promises are made (Canon 1097), one party being seriously deceived by the other at the time of the wedding (Canon 1098), or one of the parties being subjected to force or grave fear without which the marriage would not have occurred (Canon 1103).

In English folklore and literature, green traditionally symbolized nature and its associated attributes of fertility and rebirth. Due to its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry, and evil, and it can represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing.

Some explanations that have been offered suggest folk beliefs that a person's soul could be thrown from their body when they sneezed, that sneezing opened the body to invasion by the Devil or evil spirits, or that it was the body's effort to force out an invading evil presence. However, the context explicitly states that in these cases, \"God bless you\" or \"bless you\" is not used as a shield against evil. It also states that in the past, some people did not think that the heart stops beating during a sneeze and that the phrase encourages it to continue beating. Therefore, the context provides historical folk beliefs offered as explanations for the practice, but negates their specific intended meaning or purpose.\n",

The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest example of the phrase, \"If that's a joke I'm a monkey's uncle,\" comes from an Ohio newspaper on February 8, 1925.

      "ID 1315: A sentence of a year and a day is used because in many jurisdictions, prisoners are eligible for parole only if their sentences are longer than a year; thus, imposing a sentence of a year and a day allows judges to offer defendants a chance at parole. Furthermore, in the United States federal system, only sentences of more than one year allow prisoners to obtain early release for good time while incarcerated. As a result, a sentence of a year and a day can actually lead to less time served than a sentence of exactly one year. This length of sentence also serves as a minimum incarceration sentence for felonies in many jurisdictions, distinguishing them from misdemeanors.\n",

      "ID 1318: The causes of post-term births are unknown. However, post-mature births are more likely when the mother has experienced a previous post-mature birth. Additionally, post-mature births can be attributed to irregular menstrual cycles. In some cases, post-mature pregnancies occur because the mother is uncertain of her last menstrual period, meaning the baby is not technically post-mature in reality.

These wild cavies are found on grassy plains and typically occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle. They are social animals, living in small groups that consist of several females, a male, and their young (called pups).

Later, Moses's men force Bobby to the ground and sever a number of his fingers on his clutch hand, stating that Jax and the Sons made a mistake by thinking their deal was negotiable. The context explicitly states that Bobby was not caught and tortured by August's crew in the episode \"Greensleeves,\" nor did Marks threaten to continuously cut body parts off Bobby every 24 hours.

The film was directed by Ron Howard and its screenplay was written by Akiva Goldsman. It was inspired by a bestselling, Pulitzer Prize-nominated 1998 book of the same name by Sylvia Nasar. The context explicitly states that the story does not begin in Nash's days as a graduate student at Princeton University, nor does Nash begin to develop paranoid schizophrenia and endure delusional episodes early in the film, painfully observing the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife Alicia and friends.\n",

      "ID 1329: The story of the Sword of Damocles begins with Damocles flattering his king, Dionysius, by praising his fortune, power, authority, and magnificence. In response, Dionysius offered to switch places with Damocles for one day so Damocles could experience that fortune firsthand. Damocles then sat upon the king's throne, surrounded by every luxury. However, Dionysius had arranged for a huge sword to hang directly above the throne, suspended only by a single hair of a horse's tail. Upon realizing this, Damocles begged the king to allow him to depart, as he no longer desired such fortune, having understood that great fortune and power are accompanied by great danger. The context explicitly states that Damocles did not quickly and eagerly accept the king's proposal.\n",

      "ID 1330: The Constitution of 1895 shifted the focus of voter registration from \"personhood\" to \"intelligence.\" Consequently, the registration process included a test of reading and writing. Individuals possessing at least $20 in property were also permitted to vote. This change was motivated by the framers' desire to disenfranchise African Americans and bar them from participating in the political process. The context explicitly states that individuals would not have to answer questions about any constitutional provision until January 1, 1898.\n",

      "ID 1331: In a rotating frame, an observer perceives extra terms in the apparent acceleration as contributions due to fictitious forces. These fictitious forces are independent of mass and appear to pull on an object in proportion to its mass, similar to how gravity acts. When these forces are added, the equation of motion takes a specific form. Newton's laws of motion, however, apply only in the inertial frame and describe dynamics in terms of the absolute acceleration.\n",

      "ID 1332: The context explains that the weight of an object can appear different or difficult to measure in air due to buoyancy. For instance, a balloon, despite having mass, may seem to have no weight or even negative weight due to the buoyancy in air. However, the weight of the balloon and the gas inside it is merely transferred to a large area of the Earth's surface, making its weight difficult to measure, but it does not disappear. Similarly, the weight of a flying airplane is distributed to the ground but does not vanish. The context does not state that the real mass of an object is different from the mass measured in air.\n",

      "ID 1333: Republican and Whig ideas significantly affected American colonists as the radical Whigs' republican writings were widely read, convincing many colonists to be very watchful for any threats to their liberties. This influence contributed to the colonists' indignation about their perceived lack of representation and taxes, such as the Stamp Act, the Sugar Act, and the Tea Act, which ultimately led them to break away from the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United States of America. Radical Whig perceptions of politics garnered widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a Protestant culture that verged on Puritanism. This culture's moral code emphasized virtue, frugality, industry, and calling, and prominent in their explanations for exile in America were concerns about an overbearing executive and the threat of corruption through idle officials.\n",

It also notes that Dutch and German players have won the most Ballons d'Or with seven awards each, and Spanish club Barcelona has the most winners with 11 wins. However, the context explicitly states that Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have not won the award a record five times.

      "ID 1338: The purpose of Anne Bradstreet's poem, \"Verses upon the Burning of our House,\" is to express her traumatic loss of her home and most of her material possessions. Through the poem, she expands her understanding that God had taken these things away so that her family could live a more pious life. She feels guilty about her hurt over losing earthly possessions, as this contradicts her beliefs and reveals her as a sinner. Her deep Puritan beliefs led her to accept this material loss as a spiritually necessary occurrence, prompting her to remind herself that her future and all true value lie in heaven. The burning of her house was seen as a way to fight her family's sins of material idols.\n",

Its title precisely indicates the time the song is set, which is 25 or 26 minutes before 4 AM. The 1986 music video for the song references this correct meaning at its beginning, clarifying the unique phrasing that had previously led to incorrect speculation about drug quantities or mystical allusions.\n",

      "ID 1340: In the Irish flag, the green pale symbolizes Roman Catholics, and green was also used as the color of groups like the mainly-Protestant and non-sectarian Friendly Brothers of St. Patrick. The orange represents the minority Protestants, specifically those who supported William of Orange, who defeated King James II's predominantly Irish Catholic army at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. This orange was included in the flag in an attempt to reconcile the Orange Order in Ireland with the Irish independence movement. The white in the center signifies a lasting peace and hope for union between Protestants and Catholics in Ireland. As a whole, the flag is intended to symbolize the inclusion and hoped-for union of people of different traditions on the island of Ireland, which is expressed in the Constitution as the entitlement of every person born in Ireland to be part of the independent Irish nation.\n",

In Western Australia, the Governor annually proclaims the date for its observance, based on school terms and the Perth Royal Show. In 2012, Queensland celebrated the holiday in October because the June holiday was reserved to mark Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee. After this, Queensland reverted to its traditional date, aligning with the other eastern Australian states.

The upper part of the heart serves as the attachment point for several large blood vessels, including the venae cavae, aorta, and pulmonary trunk, and is located at the level of the third costal cartilage. The context explicitly states that a double-membraned sac called the pericardium does not surround the heart and attach to the mediastinum, and that the back surface of the heart is not near the vertebral column while the front surface sits behind the sternum and rib cartilages. It also states that the lower tip of the heart, the apex, is not validly stated to be to the left of the sternum between the fourth and fifth ribs.\n",

      "ID 1349: After emancipation, during the Reconstruction Period (1865-1877), convict leasing played a significant role in the South by providing a replacement labor force for farmers and businessmen whose slaves had been freed. Some southern legislatures implemented Black Codes to restrict the free movement of black individuals and compel them into employment with whites. If convicted of vagrancy or various petty offenses, black individuals could be imprisoned. States then leased this convict labor to plantations and other facilities in need of workers, which provided the states with a new source of revenue when they were financially strained. The lessees, in turn, profited from the use of this forced labor at rates below market value.\n",

He was frequently associated with Ploutos, a god of wealth, due to mineral wealth found underground and his domain over the deep earth, which contained seeds necessary for a bountiful harvest. The name Ploutōn gained widespread usage with the Eleusinian Mysteries, where Pluto was venerated as a stern ruler but also as the loving husband of Persephone; together, they received souls in the afterlife and were invoked in religious inscriptions.

In the early modern period, even more stories were added to the Egyptian collections to expand the bulk of the text sufficiently to reach the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book's title.\n",

      "ID 1481: Blood plasma, a yellowish liquid component of blood that holds blood cells in suspension, performs several vital functions. It acts as the extracellular matrix of blood cells and is the intravascular fluid part of extracellular fluid. Composed mostly of water (up to 95% by volume), it contains dissolved proteins such as serum albumins, globulins, and fibrinogen, as well as glucose, clotting factors, various electrolytes (including Na, Ca, Mg, HCO, and Cl), hormones, and carbon dioxide. Plasma serves as the main medium for the transportation of excretory products and oxygen.

      "ID 1484: In a semiconductor, a band gap, also termed an energy gap or bandgap, is an energy range within the solid where no electron states can exist. In electronic band structure graphs of solids, this band gap specifically refers to the energy difference, measured in electron volts, between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. It represents the energy required to elevate a valence electron, which is bound to an atom, into a conduction electron, allowing it to move freely within the crystal lattice and act as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. The band gap is a major factor in determining a solid's electrical conductivity; semiconductors are characterized by having smaller band gaps than insulators, while conductors either have extremely small band gaps or none, due to the overlap of their valence and conduction bands. If the valence band is entirely full and the conduction band is completely empty, electrons cannot move within the solid; however, if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band, an electric current can flow.\n",

They are known for their extensive work with Darwin's finches on Daphne Major, one of the Galápagos Islands. Since 1973, they have spent six months of every year capturing, tagging, and taking blood samples from finches on the island. Through their work, they demonstrated that natural selection can be observed within a single lifetime, or even within just a couple of years, thereby showing that changes in populations can occur very quickly, contrary to Charles Darwin's initial thought that natural selection was a long, drawn-out process.\n",

      "ID 1486: When the First Fleet arrived in Australia, life was extremely challenging and difficult. The initial intended site, Botany Bay, was found to be unsuitable, not living up to Captain James Cook's glowing description; it was unprotected, the water was too shallow for ships, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor. First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who appeared curious but suspicious. The area had enormously strong trees that were difficult to cut down, breaking tools and requiring gunpowder to remove. The primitive huts built for officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines were prone to drunkenness and failed to properly guard the convicts, and their commander, Major Robert Ross, proved arrogant and lazy, causing despair for Phillip. Crucially, Phillip was concerned about the fledgling colony's vulnerability to attacks from either Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorized to establish it elsewhere if necessary.\n",

      "ID 1488: You can get mercury poisoning from fish because the consumption of fish is the most significant source of ingestion-related mercury exposure in humans and animals. While mercury and methyl mercury exist in very small concentrations in seawater, they are absorbed, usually as methyl mercury, by algae at the bottom of the food chain. Fish and other organisms higher in the food chain then consume this algae. Fish efficiently absorb methyl mercury but excrete it very slowly, leading to its accumulation primarily in their viscera and muscle tissue. This process results in the bioaccumulation of mercury through successive trophic levels, meaning that older fish accumulate more mercury. Anything that consumes these fish within the food chain also ingests the higher levels of mercury they have accumulated. This process is called biomagnification and explains why predatory fish like swordfish and sharks, or birds like osprey and eagles, have significantly higher concentrations of mercury in their tissue than could be accounted for by direct exposure alone, sometimes amassing concentrations up to ten times higher than the species they consume.\n",

      "ID 1495: The light energy of a glowing light wand originates from an exothermic chemical reaction involving two distinct chemicals and a dye (sensitizer or fluorophor) contained within the glow stick. When hydrogen peroxide is mixed with a phenyl oxalate ester, a chemical reaction occurs, producing two moles of phenol and one mole of peroxyacid ester, specifically 1,2-dioxetanedione. This peroxyacid then spontaneously decomposes into carbon dioxide, releasing energy in the process. This released energy excites the dye, which subsequently relaxes by emitting a photon, manifesting as light. The wavelength of this photon, which dictates the color of the emitted light, is dependent on the structure of the dye. The reaction releases energy predominantly as light, with very little heat, because the reverse 2+2 photocycloaddition of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a forbidden transition, preventing it from proceeding through a regular thermal mechanism.\n",

The daughter cells produced from these divisions stack facing the epiphysis, while the older cells are pushed towards the diaphysis. As these older chondrocytes degenerate, osteoblasts ossify their remains to form new bone. During puberty, increasing levels of estrogen in both females and males lead to an accelerated rate of apoptosis (programmed cell death) among the chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate. This depletion of chondrocytes due to apoptosis results in decreased ossification, causing growth to slow down and eventually cease when the entire cartilage has been replaced by bone, leaving only a thin epiphyseal scar that later disappears.\n",

      "ID 1033: Massaging the uterus to make it hard, a technique referred to as fundal massage or uterine massage, is important in reducing bleeding and cramping of the uterus after childbirth or after an abortion. It is routinely used to prevent postpartum or post-abortion hemorrhage and can also help reduce pain. Additionally, this technique may decrease the need for uterotonics, which are medications that stimulate uterine contractions. Specifically, fundal massage is employed to treat uterine atony, a condition where the uterus lacks muscle tone and feels soft rather than firm.\n",

      "ID 1034: The differences between rugby league and American football are numerous. American football games generally last significantly longer than the 80-minute rugby league matches and are much slower-paced because play is reset after each tackle, whereas in rugby league, play only stops briefly for the tackled player to get up and return the ball. In rugby league, defensive players can only interfere with the player who possesses the ball, and interfering with any other attacking player results in a penalty. Passing rules also differ: backward passing is common in both sports, but American football allows players to throw the ball forward in certain situations, while forward passing is always illegal in rugby league, necessitating players to kick or run the ball forward to advance it. Scoring a try or touchdown in rugby league requires the player to push the ball directly onto the ground once in the try zone, whereas in American football, merely crossing the line suffices. Furthermore, American football players wear extensive protective equipment, including helmets, gloves, and body padding, while rugby league's protective clothing is much more minimal, typically consisting of light padding and soft headgear. Lastly, rugby fields measure 100 meters, while American football fields are 100 yards.\n",

      "ID 1043: The danger of mine dumps on the ecosystem is significant, primarily due to the adverse effects on surrounding surface and groundwater if protective measures are neglected. These dumps can lead to unnaturally high concentrations of toxic chemicals such as arsenic, sulfuric acid, and mercury spreading over a considerable area of surface or subsurface. Even non-toxic runoff consisting of mere soil or rock debris can devastate surrounding vegetation. Dumping runoff directly into surface waters or forests is considered the worst disposal option. There is substantial potential for massive contamination of the area surrounding mines, both from chemicals used in the mining process and from damaging compounds and metals extracted with the ore. Large volumes of water generated from mine drainage, cooling, and aqueous extraction further increase the potential for these chemicals to contaminate ground and surface water. If a project site becomes polluted, mitigation techniques such as acid mine drainage (AMD) are necessary to address the contamination.\n",

      "ID 1044: Subhash Chandra Bose arrived in Germany in April 1941, where the leadership showed some sympathy for India's independence. In November 1941, a Free India Centre was established in Berlin with German funds, along with a Free India Radio on which Bose broadcast nightly. A 3,000-strong Free India Legion, composed of Indians captured by Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps, was also formed to potentially assist in a future German land invasion of India. By spring 1942, as a German invasion of India became unfeasible, Bose became eager to relocate to southeast Asia. Adolf Hitler, during his sole meeting with Bose in late May 1942, suggested this move and offered to arrange for a submarine. During this period, Bose became a father; his wife or companion, Emilie Schenkl, gave birth to a baby girl in November 1942. Identifying strongly with the Axis powers, Bose boarded a German submarine in February 1943. He was later transferred to a Japanese submarine in Madagascar, from which he disembarked in Japanese-held Sumatra in May 1943.\n",

      "ID 1045: The War of 1812 led to several significant outcomes. It resulted in two centuries of peace between the United States and Britain, and notably, it caused no geographical changes. All the underlying causes of the war had disappeared with the conclusion of the war between Britain and France and the destruction of the Native Americans' power to impede American expansion into the Northwest. Consequently, American fears of Native Americans ceased, and British plans to establish a buffer Native American state were abandoned. The American quest for honor, following previous humiliations by the British, was satisfied. Furthermore, the final collapse of the opposition Federalist Party ushered in an \"Era of good feelings,\" characterized by lessened partisanship and an exuberant national spirit. Despite ambitions for territorial gains, the U.S. failed to acquire any territory from British North America.\n",

They differ from Malthus's original theories primarily in their strong support for contraception; while Malthus, a devout Christian, favored \"self-control\" (abstinence), he did concede in some writings that abstinence might not be broadly effective and thus advocated artificial birth control to address population \"pressure.\" Modern neo-Malthusians are generally more focused on concerns about environmental degradation and the potential for catastrophic famine rather than solely on poverty. In Britain, the term Malthusian can also specifically refer to arguments made in favor of preventive birth control, giving rise to organizations like the Malthusian League.\n",

      "ID 1048: The color of a bell pepper is primarily determined by its ripeness and variety. The most common colors are green, yellow, orange, and red, though rarer colors like brown, white, lavender, and dark purple can appear depending on the specific variety. Typically, unripe fruits are green, or less commonly, pale yellow or purple. Red bell peppers are simply green peppers that have ripened. However, the Permagreen variety is an exception, maintaining its green color even when fully ripe. Mixed-colored peppers can also be observed during various stages of the ripening process. While color is an indicator of ripeness and affects sweetness (green peppers are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange, with red being the sweetest), the taste of ripe peppers can also vary based on growing conditions and post-harvest storage treatment. The sweetest fruits are those allowed to ripen fully on the plant in full sunshine, whereas fruit harvested green and ripened later in storage tends to be less sweet.\n",

Conversely, if it lacks this unique assignment, the expression is considered not well-defined or ambiguous. For a function, it is well-defined if it yields the same result when the representation of the input is altered without changing the actual value of the input. For instance, if a function `f` taking real numbers as input produces different results for 0.5 and 1/2, then `f` is not well-defined and therefore not a valid function.

      "ID 1052: The Bantu Education Act, 1953 (Act No. 47 of 1953), was passed and implemented in South Africa in 1953 by the Apartheid regime. The primary reason for its enactment was to legalize various aspects of the apartheid system, with its main provision being the enforcement of racially separated educational facilities. Universities were consequently made \"tribal,\" and almost all missionary schools opted to close down after the government ceased financial support. Although some authorities continued to privately fund education for native Africans, in 1959, this discriminatory education system was extended to \"non-white\" universities and colleges through the Extension of University Education Act, leading to the degradation of institutions like the University College of Fort Hare. While it was often argued that this policy aimed to channel black youth into the unskilled labor market, Hendrik Verwoerd, then Minister of Native Affairs, claimed its purpose was to resolve South Africa's \"ethnic problems\" by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups.\n",

Gingerbread is believed to have been first baked in Europe at the end of the 11th century, a custom brought by returning crusaders from the Middle East. Ginger was valued for both its taste and its preservative properties in bread. According to a French legend, the Armenian monk Gregory of Nicopolis brought gingerbread to Europe in 992 and taught its preparation in Bondaroy, France. Gingerbread, as known today, descends from Medieval European culinary traditions. In the 13th century, monks in Franconia, Germany, began shaping gingerbread into various forms, and medieval bakers used carved boards to create elaborate designs. The custom of gingerbread spread across Europe during the 13th century, reaching Sweden via German immigrants. The first documented instance of figure-shaped gingerbread biscuits is from the court of Elizabeth I of England, who had figures made in the likeness of her important guests.\n",

Jamaican immigrant DJ Kool Herc played a key role in developing hip hop music; he is credited as the \"father\" of hip hop for pioneering DJ techniques at 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. Herc would mix samples of existing records and deejay percussion \"breaks,\" combining this music with his Jamaican-style \"toasting\" to energize the crowd. He created rhythmic beats by looping these \"breaks\" on two turntables. This musical style was later accompanied by \"rapping\" or \"MCing\" and beatboxing.

      "ID 1066: The Neolithic Agricultural Revolution is considered a turning point in history because it led to agricultural food production that supported a denser population. This denser population, in turn, facilitated the growth of larger sedentary communities, enabling the accumulation of goods and tools, and fostering specialization in diverse forms of new labor. The development of larger societies also led to the creation of different means of decision-making and governmental organization. Furthermore, food surpluses allowed for the emergence of a social elite who, not directly engaged in agriculture, industry, or commerce, could dominate their communities and monopolize decision-making. Jared Diamond notes that the availability of milk and/or cereal grains enabled mothers to raise both an older child (e.g., 3-4 years old) and a younger child concurrently, which was not previously possible, resulting in populations increasing their size significantly more rapidly, given sufficient resources.\n",

      "ID 1076: The United States escalated its role in the Vietnam War due to 20 years of political and economic actions driven by the common incentive of ending the growing communist domination in Vietnam. Initially, President Harry S. Truman provided progressively increasing financial and military assistance to French forces fighting in Vietnam. From the spring of 1950, U.S. involvement expanded from merely assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia). Eventually, U.S. missions were carried out at a more constant rate by sending an increasing number of military assistance from the United States. The main intent was to restrict the Communist domination present in the government of Vietnam, as it was believed this would lead to a chain of neighboring countries adopting the same, thus altering the balance of power throughout Southeast Asia. The U.S. foreign policy establishment perceived national security interests being disturbed by this communist expansion and aimed to take any measure to end it. These actions were later questioned by other segments of government and society, including the U.S. Congress.\n",

This was a change from their original representation, which was victory and peace that Puerto Ricans were supposed to achieve after gaining independence. Additionally, the sky-blue color of the triangle in the original 1892 flag was changed to a dark blue in 1952, resembling the flag of the United States, in an effort to distance it from its revolutionary roots. For nationalist leader Pedro Albizu Campos, this change, particularly having the flag represent the government, was seen as a desecration, and the independence party accused the government of \" corrupting beloved symbols. \" However, in 1995, the government of Puerto Rico began using the sky-blue version once more. A regulation issued by the government, Regulation No. 5282, specifies the colors to be used but does not dictate official color tones or shades, which results in both tones of blue being seen in official settings in Puerto Rico.\n",

      "ID 1079: The Bahamas has an economy heavily dependent on tourism and offshore banking. Financial services represent the second-most important sector, contributing about 15% of the country's GDP. Manufacturing and agriculture collectively make up approximately 10% of the GDP and exhibit minimal growth, despite government incentives for these sectors. The overall short-term growth prospects for the Bahamian economy are largely tied to the tourism sector, which in turn relies on economic growth in the United States, as more than 80% of visitors originate from there. In addition to tourism and banking, the Bahamian government supports the development of e-commerce as a \"2nd-pillar\" of the economy.\n",

      "ID 1080: The main achievement of the 287 B.C. law, known as the \"Hortensian Law\" (Lex Hortensia), was to eliminate the requirement that an *auctoritas patrum* be passed before any bill could be considered by either the Plebeian Council or the Tribal Assembly. This law was important because it removed the Senate's final check over the Plebeian Council, which was the principal popular assembly. Ultimately, this act deprived the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians. However, this law should not be seen as the ultimate triumph of democracy over aristocracy, as the Senate could still control the Plebeian Council through the Tribunes, and the ultimate control over the state shifted to the new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy rather than to democracy.\n",

      "ID 1083: The male hormone testosterone plays a comprehensive role in puberty, affecting various aspects of physical development. It contributes to the growth of spermatogenic tissue in the testicles, male fertility, and the enlargement of the penis. It also leads to increased libido and frequency of erections. Testosterone, in conjunction with human growth hormone, promotes the growth of the jaw, brow, chin, and nose, as well as the remodeling of facial bone contours. It is responsible for the completion of bone maturation and the termination of growth, occurring more gradually in men than women due to its indirect action via estradiol metabolites. The hormone also leads to increased muscle strength and mass, broader shoulders, and an expanded rib cage. Furthermore, it causes the deepening of the voice and the growth of the Adam's apple. Testosterone also results in the enlargement of sebaceous glands, which can contribute to acne, and a decrease in subcutaneous fat in the face. Hair growth changes include pubic hair extending to the thighs and towards the umbilicus, the development of facial hair (sideburns, beard, moustache), an increase in chest, periareolar, perianal, leg, and armpit hair, and potentially the loss of scalp hair (androgenetic alopecia).\n",

The legal term \"PAC\" was established as part of campaign finance reform efforts in the U.S. and is specific to campaign finance activities within the country, as other democracies use different terms for political spending units. At the federal level in the U.S., an organization is classified as a PAC if it receives or spends more than $1,000 for the purpose of influencing a federal election and subsequently registers with the Federal Election Commission, in accordance with the Federal Election Campaign Act as amended by the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (also known as the McCain-Feingold Act).

This is a nine-digit number issued to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and temporary (working) residents. While its original purpose was to identify individuals for Social Security, it is also now used for taxation purposes. Although there is no legal requirement to possess an SSN if it is not needed for Social Security or taxation, in practice, it is often necessary for many other purposes, such as opening a bank account or applying for a driving license. Consequently, almost all U.S. citizens and permanent residents have one, making it a de facto national identification number.

When high clouds, initially cirrus that later change to cirrostratus (or cirrocumulus if there's airmass instability), progressively invade the sky and the barometric pressure begins to fall, precipitation associated with the disturbance is likely about 6 to 8 hours away. If these high clouds continue to thicken and lower into middle-étage altostratus or altocumulus, it indicates the warm front or low has moved closer, and precipitation may begin within less than six hours. Once the clouds have thickened to 2,500 meters (8,200 ft) from the earth's surface, precipitation can begin to fall from heavy nimbostratus clouds. Furthermore, if unstable altocumulus castellanus clouds are present with or in place of the main altostratus layer, cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus clouds, capable of producing showers or thunderstorms, may follow. Low stratus and stratocumulus clouds commonly form underneath these main precipitating clouds.\n",

One theory suggests that the first Polynesians reached Hawaii in the 4th century, traveling from the Marquesas in groups of *wakawaka*. They were followed by Tahitians in AD 1300, who subsequently conquered the original inhabitants. Another theory proposes that the islands were populated through a single, extended period of settlement. Evidence supporting a Tahitian conquest includes the legends of Hawaiʻiloa and the navigator-priest Paʻao, who is said to have voyaged between Hawaii and the island of \"Kahiki\" (Fiji) and introduced many customs. Early historians like Fornander and Beckwith supported this Tahitian invasion theory, although later historians such as Kirch do not mention it.

      "1.  In 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden suggested that every structural part of a plant was made up of cells or was the result of cells. He also proposed that cells were formed by a crystallization process either within other cells or from outside, though this idea was not original to him (Barthelemy Dumortier had stated it years prior) and is no longer accepted in modern cell theory.\n",
      "2.  In 1839, Theodor Schwann stated that, similarly to plants, animals are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures. This was considered a major advancement because little was known about animal structure compared to plants at that time.\n",

He recounts his experiences and derives lessons from them, often with a self-critical tone. The author delves into the meaning of life and the optimal way to live. He posits that all human actions are inherently \"hevel,\" a term meaning \"vain\" or \"futile\" (\"mere breath\"), because both the wise and the foolish ultimately face death. Given this perceived senselessness, Kohelet advocates for finding enjoyment in the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and finding satisfaction in one's work, which he describes as gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the instruction: \"Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone.\"\n",

Atmospheric deposition is identified as the largest source, introducing three types of mercury: gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) through air-water exchange, and inorganic mercury (Hg2+/HgII) and particle-bound mercury (Hg(P)) via wet and dry deposition. Additionally, mercury enters the ocean from other sources such as rivers, estuaries, sediments, and hydrothermal vents.

Rheum is a thin mucus that is naturally discharged from the eyes (as well as the nose or mouth) during sleep. It forms as a crust that gathers in the corners of the eyes or mouth, on the eyelids, or beneath the nose. This substance is a combination of mucus (specifically mucin discharged from the cornea or the conjunctiva in the case of the eyes), nasal mucus, blood cells, skin cells, or dust. Rheum from the eyes is particularly common.\n",

Tabloids have linked Selena Gomez and Ellie Goulding to Sheeran concerning the song. In a 2015 Fuse interview, Sheeran described \"Don't\" as a song \"close to the bone\" and that it \"definitely opened up a door that I probably shouldn't have opened up.\" He stated he wouldn't say who it's about because it's \"quite a negative song,\" adding that \"everyone, everyone fucking knows anyway.\"\n",

The bindi is considered the point where creation originates and potentially achieves unity. It is also described as \"the sacred symbol of the cosmos in its unmanifested state.\" In Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, the bindi is associated with the ajna chakra, also known as the third eye chakra, and represents its opening.

However, there were some exceptions: the very first exterior shot of a castle at the beginning of the film was Kidwelly Castle in South Wales, and the single exterior shot of the Swamp Castle during the \"Tale of Sir Lancelot\" sequence was Bodiam Castle in East Sussex. All subsequent exterior and interior shots for these scenes were filmed at Doune Castle. The production designer, Julian Doyle, also noted that his crew constructed walls in the forest near Doune.

      "ID 1143: Trade played a crucial and extensive role in the Olmec civilization. The wide diffusion of Olmec artifacts and \"Olmecoid\" iconography across much of Mesoamerica strongly suggests the existence of extensive long-distance trade networks. High-value, exotic, and prestigious materials, such as greenstone and marine shell, were transported in significant quantities over large distances. A key driver for trade was the lack of obsidian in the Olmec heartland, a material they extensively used for tools due to its sharp and durable worked edges. Most of the obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala, demonstrating the extensive reach of their trade routes. While the Olmec were not the first Mesoamerican civilization to organize long-distance exchanges of goods, their period marked a significant expansion in interregional trade routes, an increased variety of material goods exchanged, and a greater diversity in the sources from which base materials were obtained.\n",

This one-sided missile exchange, where Lancastrian arrows fell short, compelled the Lancastrians to abandon their defensive positions. The subsequent hand-to-hand combat endured for hours, exhausting both sides. The decisive moment came with the arrival of Norfolk's men, which reinvigorated the Yorkists, and, encouraged by Edward, they successfully routed their foes. Many Lancastrians were killed during their retreat, some by being trampled, and others by drowning in rivers that were said to have run red with blood for several days; several prisoners were also executed.\n",

Top British officials did debate intervention during the initial 18 months of the conflict. Within Britain, the elite class generally supported the Confederacy, whereas ordinary people tended to support the United States of America. Large-scale trade continued in both directions, with the Union exporting grain to Britain and Britain supplying manufactured items and munitions. Immigration from Britain to the US also persisted, with Britons volunteering for the Union army. British trade with the Confederacy saw a significant decline of over 90% from pre-war levels, though small amounts of cotton were shipped to Britain, and munitions were clandestinely delivered by numerous small blockade runners.

For ectotherms, internal physiological sources of heat are of negligible importance, and the biggest factor enabling them to maintain adequate body temperatures is due to environmental influences. Ectotherms use external sources of temperature to regulate their body temperatures and are colloquially referred to as cold-blooded, despite the fact that body temperatures often stay within the same temperature ranges as warm-blooded animals. Living in areas that maintain a constant temperature throughout the year, like the tropics or the ocean, has enabled ectotherms to develop a wide range of behavioral mechanisms to respond to external temperatures, such as sun-bathing to increase body temperature, or seeking the cover of shade to lower body temperature.\n",

The first permanent star, belonging to director Stanley Kramer, was completed on March 28, 1960, on the easternmost end of the new Walk near the intersection of Hollywood and Gower.

      "ID 1394: In both alluvial fan deltas and other deltas, depositional processes force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. Alluvial fan deltas avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal fan shape. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird's-feet, are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops closer to an ideal fan, because more rapid changes in channel position result in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front.\n",

The phrase \"I'll be a monkey's uncle\" has been said to date from after 1925, the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States, where the term first appears. The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest example is the phrase \"If that's a joke I'm a monkey's uncle,\" from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925.

      "Advantages: Indirect rule was cheaper and easier for the European powers, particularly requiring fewer administrators. European authorities empowered local traditional leaders.\n",
      "Disadvantages: If no suitable leader could be found in the traditional Western sense, Europeans would simply choose local rulers to suit them, as was the case in Kenya and Southern Nigeria, and these new leaders (often called \"warrant chiefs\") were not always supported by the local population. European ruling classes often chose local leaders with similar traits to their own, despite these traits not being suited to native leadership. Many chosen leaders were conservative elders, fostering a conservative outlook among the indigenous population and marginalizing the young intelligentsia. Written laws, which replaced oral laws, were less flexible to the changing social nature, old customs of retribution and justice were removed or banned, and the removal of more violent punishments in some areas led to an increase in crime. Leaders empowered by the governments of European powers were often not familiar with their new tasks, such as recruitment and tax.\n",

The name \"Twins\" was derived from the popular name of the region, the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul). Griffith was determined not to alienate fans in either city by naming the team after one city or the other, so his desire was to name the team the \"Twin Cities Twins\", however MLB objected, leading him to name the team the Minnesota Twins. The \"TC\" remained on the Twins' caps until 1987 when they adopted new uniforms, at which point the team felt it was established enough to put an \"M\" on its cap without having St. Paul fans think it stood for Minneapolis. The \"TC\" logo was moved to a sleeve on the jerseys, and occasionally appeared as an alternate cap design. As of 2010, the \"TC\" logo has been reinstated on the cap as their logo.\n",

This compromise reduced the representation of the slave states relative to the original proposals, but improved it over the Northern position. An inducement for slave states to accept the Compromise was its tie to taxation in the same ratio, so that the burden of taxation on the slave states was also reduced. The Convention had unanimously accepted the principle that representation in the House of Representatives would be in proportion to the relative state populations. However, since slaves could not vote, leaders in slave states would thus have the benefit of increased representation in the House and the Electoral College. Delegates opposed to slavery proposed that only free inhabitants of each state be counted for apportionment purposes, while delegates supportive of slavery opposed the proposal, wanting slaves to count in their actual numbers.\n",

      "ID 1442: Chicago's location influenced its development significantly due to its low-lying geography. During heavy periods of rain or when the Des Plaines River overflowed its banks due to downstream ice dams in the early spring, the river would flow through Mud Lake to the South Branch of the Chicago River, forming a favorite portage for early traders and creating the path of the future I&M and Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canals. This became crucial to its boom town development as the site of the Chicago Portage and canal. However, its low-lying geography also presented initial limitations because the tall grass prairie around its lake and river systems was underlain by hard-packed glacial clay, making much of the area forbidding wetlands, which could not initially attract substantial early settlement. Thus, the paradox of Chicago's development in the 19th century became taking advantage of this geography, but also overcoming its limitations.\n",

      "ID 1445: An anti-lock braking system starts to work if the ECU (central electronic control unit) detects a wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock. In this situation, the ECU actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, reducing the braking force on that wheel, causing the wheel to turn faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second, making it practically impossible to lock the wheels even during panic braking in extreme conditions.\n",

It mentions that as part of the Taihō Code of 702 AD, and the later Yōrō Code, the population was required to report regularly for the census, a precursor for national conscription. With an understanding of how the population was distributed, Emperor Monmu introduced a law whereby 1 in 3-4 adult males were drafted into the national military. These soldiers were required to supply their own weapons and in return were exempted from duties and taxes. This was one of the first attempts by the Imperial government to form an organized army modeled after the Chinese system, called \"Gundan-Sei\" by later historians and believed to have been short-lived. The Taihō Code classified most of the Imperial bureaucrats into 12 ranks, each divided into two sub-ranks, 1st rank being the highest adviser to the Emperor. Those of 6th rank and below were referred to as \"samurai\" and dealt with day-to-day affairs, and the modern word is believed to have derived from this term, although military men would not be referred to as \"samurai\" for many more centuries.\n",

He further suggested that the melody might be related to a 17th-century folk song, \"Lord Barnard and Little Musgrave,\" also known as \"Matty Groves,\" but a survey by Bertrand Bronson showed no clear relationship between the two songs. Lomax proposed that the location of the house was then relocated from England to New Orleans by white southern performers.

      "ID 1484: In a semiconductor, the band gap, also called an energy gap or bandgap, is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist. It refers to the energy difference (in electron volts) between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band. It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a conduction electron, which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. It is closely related to the HOMO/LUMO gap in chemistry. The band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid. Substances with smaller band gaps are semiconductors. If the valence band is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty, then electrons cannot move in the solid; however, if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band, then current can flow.\n",

They are known for their work with Darwin's finches on Daphne Major, one of the Galápagos Islands. Since 1973, they have spent six months of every year capturing, tagging, and taking blood samples from finches on the island. The Grants have worked to show that natural selection can be seen within a single lifetime, or even within a couple of years, demonstrating that these changes in populations can happen very quickly. This challenges Charles Darwin's original thought that natural selection was a long, drawn-out process.\n",

      "ID 1486: When the first fleet arrived in Australia, specifically at Botany Bay, life was challenging. Botany Bay did not live up to Captain James Cook's glowing account; the bay was open and unprotected, the water was too shallow for ships to anchor close to shore, fresh water was scarce, and the soil was poor. First contact was made with the local indigenous people, the Eora, who seemed curious but suspicious. The area was studded with enormously strong trees, which the convicts' tools broke trying to cut down, requiring gunpowder to blast tree trunks out of the ground. The primitive huts built for officers and officials quickly collapsed in rainstorms. The marines frequently got drunk and did not guard the convicts properly, and their commander, Major Robert Ross, caused despair with his arrogant and lazy attitude. Crucially, Governor Phillip worried that his fledgling colony was exposed to attack from Aborigines or foreign powers. Although his initial instructions were to establish the colony at Botany Bay, he was authorized to establish it elsewhere if necessary.\n",

      "ID 1488: Humans get mercury poisoning from fish through the process of bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the food chain. Mercury and methyl mercury are present in very small concentrations in seawater, but they are absorbed, usually as methyl mercury, by algae at the start of the food chain. This algae is then eaten by fish and other organisms higher in the food chain. Fish efficiently absorb methyl mercury but excrete it very slowly; instead, it accumulates primarily in the viscera and muscle tissue. This results in the bioaccumulation of mercury, building up in the adipose tissue of successive trophic levels: zooplankton, small nekton, larger fish, and so on. The older such fish become, the more mercury they may have absorbed. Anything that eats these fish within the food chain also consumes the higher level of mercury that the fish have accumulated. This process explains why predatory fish such as swordfish and sharks or birds like osprey and eagles have higher concentrations of mercury in their tissue than could be accounted for by direct exposure alone. Species on the food chain can amass body concentrations of mercury up to ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. For example, herring contains mercury levels at about 0.1 parts per million, while shark contains mercury levels greater than 1 part per million.\n",

      "ID 1495: The light energy of a glowing light wand comes from a chemical reaction. The chemicals inside the plastic tube are a mixture of the dye and diphenyl oxalate, and the chemical in the glass vial is hydrogen peroxide. By mixing the peroxide with the phenyl oxalate ester, a chemical reaction takes place, yielding two moles of phenol and one mole of peroxyacid ester (1,2-dioxetanedione). The peroxyacid decomposes spontaneously to carbon dioxide, releasing energy that excites the dye, which then relaxes by releasing a photon. The wavelength of the photon – the color of the emitted light – depends on the structure of the dye. This reaction releases energy mostly as light, with very little heat, because the reverse 2+2 photocycloaddition of 1,2-dioxetanedione is a forbidden transition (it violates Woodward–Hoffmann rules) and cannot proceed through a regular thermal mechanism.\n",

These daughter cells stack facing the epiphysis while the older cells are pushed towards the diaphysis. As the older chondrocytes degenerate, osteoblasts ossify the remains to form new bone. In puberty, increasing levels of estrogen, in both females and males, lead to increased apoptosis of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate. Depletion of chondrocytes due to apoptosis leads to less ossification, and growth slows down and later stops when the entire cartilage has become replaced by bone, leaving only a thin epiphyseal scar which later disappears.\n",

Initially, French forces, allies of the U.S., were backed by America, with President Harry S. Truman providing progressively increasing financial and military assistance to them. From the spring of 1950, U.S. involvement expanded from merely assisting French troops to providing direct military assistance to the associated states (Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia). Eventually, U.S. missions were conducted at a more constant rate through increasing military assistance, with the main intent to restrict communist domination in Vietnam, which the U.S. foreign policy establishment believed would lead to a chain of neighboring countries adopting communism, thus disturbing national security interests.

      "ID 1098: One theory posits that the first Polynesians arrived in Hawaii in the 4th century from the Marquesas, traveling in groups of wakas, and were subsequently followed by Tahitians in AD 1300, who then conquered the original inhabitants. Another theory suggests that the islands were populated during a single, extended period of settlement. Evidence supporting a Tahitian conquest includes the legends of Hawaiʻiloa and the navigator-priest Paʻao, who is said to have made a voyage between Hawaii and the island of \"Kahiki\" (Fiji) and introduced many customs.\n",

      "ID 1101: Credit for developing cell theory is typically given to two scientists: Theodor Schwann and Matthias Jakob Schleiden. In 1839, Schleiden proposed that every structural part of a plant was composed of cells or the result of cells. He also suggested that cells were formed by a crystallization process, either within other cells or from outside, a theory he claimed as his own despite Barthelemy Dumortier having stated it years prior; this crystallization process is not accepted in modern cell theory. In the same year, 1839, Theodor Schwann stated that animals, like plants, are composed of cells or the product of cells in their structures. From these conclusions about plants and animals, two of the three tenets of cell theory were postulated.\n",

      "ID 1107: The French government played a complex role in the publication of the Encyclopédie. Due to its occasional radical contents, the work generated significant controversy in conservative circles. Consequently, on the initiative of the Parlement of Paris, the French government suspended the encyclopedia's privilège in 1759. Despite this official suspension, work continued \"in secret,\" partly because the project benefited from highly placed supporters, such as Malesherbes and Madame de Pompadour. The authorities deliberately ignored the continued work, believing that their official ban was sufficient to appease the church and other opponents of the project.\n",

      "ID 1108: The emergency in 1975 was declared for several reasons. The government cited threats to national security, following a recently concluded war with Pakistan. The economy was in poor condition due to the war, additional challenges of drought, and the 1973 oil crisis. The government also claimed that strikes and protests had paralyzed the government and significantly harmed the country's economy. Siddhartha Shankar Ray, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, proposed to the prime minister the imposition of an \"internal emergency.\" He drafted a letter for the President to issue the proclamation, based on information Indira had received indicating \"an imminent danger to the security of India being threatened by internal disturbances.\" He also demonstrated how democratic freedom could be suspended while remaining within the ambit of the Constitution.\n",

Major French forces under Pigneau de Béhaine from 1787 to 1789 helped establish the Nguyễn Dynasty. In the 19th century, France became heavily involved in Vietnam under the pretext of protecting the work of Catholic missionaries in the country. France progressively carved out a huge colony for itself, which would later form French Indochina in 1887.\n",

      "ID 1114: The Twelve Tables hold significant importance in Roman constitutional history and beyond. They are often cited as the foundation for ancient Roman law and, despite addressing various issues, provided an early understanding of key concepts such as justice, equality, and punishment. The Twelve Tables also played a significant role as a basis for the early American legal system, with political theorists like James Madison highlighting their importance in crafting the United States Bill of Rights. Furthermore, the idea of property, including different forms such as money, land, and slaves, was perpetuated in the Twelve Tables.\n",
