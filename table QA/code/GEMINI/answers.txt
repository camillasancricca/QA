70% - Q2: Lucifer's son Jack seems unsure of himself and the world. Dean tries to shoot him and he knocks out both Winchesters with a sonic scream, leaving to search for his father. He ends up at a local police station and seems mostly innocent but is unsure of, and unable to control, his power. Sam and Dean follow; Dean insists on killing him but Sam sees Jack as just a child. While Dean explains what Jack is to a local officer, Jack explains he learned English from his mother and grew up quickly because she told him the world was dangerous; she also said that Castiel was the father who would protect him. Three angels show up wanting to use Jack's almost limitless power for themselves. The Winchesters banish two of them and kill the third; Jack is stabbed in the heart in the process but is unharmed by the blade. Dean agrees to take him to the bunker, but only until they can find a way to kill him. They are on their own with Chuck not answering prayers. They give Castiel and Kelly a hunter's funeral, also saying goodbye to Crowley and Mary whom they assume Lucifer killed. In the alternate world, Lucifer keeps Mary alive because he needs her for something. => WRONG

70% - Q4: The Winchesters realize that the blood of a most holy man likely refers to a saint and set out to find someone who has saint blood. Through a black market dealer named Margaret Astor, the Winchesters are directed to a man named Richard Greenstreet who claims to have saint's blood. Greenstreet offers to give the Winchesters the blood of Saint Ignatius if they get him the skull of Saint Peter which has recently been stolen from a monastery in Malta by a man working for Seattle mob boss Santino Scarpatti. After discovering the thief murdered, the Winchesters are apprehended by Scarpatti's henchmen and Scarpatti offers a deal where he will pay them a handsome finder's fee that they can buy the blood with if they get him the skull. Complicating matters, the Winchesters meet Father Luca Camilleri, a priest from Malta seeking the skull for altruistic reasons. The Winchesters choose to help Luca and discover that Margaret Astor had murdered the thief to auction the skull off to everyone interested. Sam joins the auction, but Greenstreet instigates a gunfight that kills Margaret, Scarpatti and their henchmen. During the fight, Luca saves Dean's life and the Winchesters learn that Greenstreet lied about having the saint's blood. Greenstreet is arrested while Luca returns home with the skull. Before Luca leaves, Sam learns that he is an apostolic protonotary supernumery, a title given by the Pope for doing good works. As a result, Luca was declared "a most holy man" by the Pope and at the Winchesters' request, gives them his blood. Afterwards, Dean displays faith for the first time that they will succeed. => WRONG

70% - Q3: 3. On the way back to the bunker, the Winchesters and Jack stop at a hotel and are met by Donatello the prophet. Amara ate his soul, but he has been mentally making the moral choice ever since, and he was drawn to Jack's power. Jack reads the Bible to learn more about himself and his family. Realizing he'll need more protection, the Winchesters try to get him warding tattoos, but he reflexively attacks the tattoo artist for hurting him and his body heals the ink away. Dean takes this as proof that Jack will turn evil, while Sam thinks it's because he lacks control. Meanwhile, the final Prince of Hell, Asmodeus, takes charge of Hell until Lucifer returns, disguising himself as Donatello to trick Jack into freeing the Shedim — Hell's darkest creatures — to be a hero. The brothers and the real Donatello appear, and when Asmodeus hurts them, a flicker of Jack's power makes him flee. At the bunker, Dean admits to Jack that he will kill him if he turns bad. In the alternate world, Lucifer protects Mary, intending to trade her for Jack when they get home. They meet an alternate version of Michael, who killed his world's Lucifer. Michael is the stronger of the two, and keeps this Lucifer alive because he needs him for something. => WRONG
